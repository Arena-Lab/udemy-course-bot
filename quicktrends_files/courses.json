Affirmations help improve mental strength, introduce new positive ideas, reinforce existing positive ideas, all in the hope of creating positive outcomes.

It is also a process and requires dedication, discipline, adaptability and flexibility.\nAffirmations are NOT a replacement for taking action. \nThey are to support you in getting to solutions for issues you face in life. They help:\n1). Empower the Affirmer that they can engage with the issues at hand\n2). They help reframe the problems to make less overwhelming\n3).
